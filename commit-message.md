Git commit messages are short descriptions of the changes that were made in a particular commit. They should 
be written in a way that is clear, concise, and informative, so that other developers can understand 
what was done and why.

Here are some examples of good commit messages:

- "Fixed bug in login page where passwords were not being hashed correctly"
- "Added new feature for exporting data to CSV"
- "Refactored code for better performance"
- "Updated dependencies to latest version"
- "Added tests for new feature"
- "Changed variable names for better readability"
- "Adjusted layout for mobile devices"
- "Removed unnecessary code"
- "Fixed security vulnerability"
- "Merged in changes from development branch"

Each commit message should be written in a way that describes the changes made in a clear and concise
way, that is easy to understand, and that provides enough context to understand why the change was made. 
Avoid generic messages like "change something" or "fix stuff".

It's also a good practice to use a prefix in the commit message to indicate the type of changes made like
fix:, feat:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test: and so on. 
This helps to quickly identify the type of change and make the message more informative.
