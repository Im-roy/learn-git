<b>Git commit messages are short descriptions of the changes that were made in a particular commit. They should 
be written in a way that is clear, concise, and informative, so that other developers can understand 
what was done and why. </b>

Here are some examples of good commit messages:

- "Fixed bug in login page where passwords were not being hashed correctly"
- "Added new feature for exporting data to CSV"
- "Refactored code for better performance"
- "Updated dependencies to latest version"
- "Added tests for new feature"
- "Changed variable names for better readability"
- "Adjusted layout for mobile devices"
- "Removed unnecessary code"
- "Fixed security vulnerability"
- "Merged in changes from development branch"

Each commit message should be written in a way that describes the changes made in a clear and concise
way, that is easy to understand, and that provides enough context to understand why the change was made. 
Avoid generic messages like "change something" or "fix stuff".

It's also a good practice to use a prefix in the commit message to indicate the type of changes made like
<i>fix:, feat:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test: </i>and so on. 
This helps to quickly identify the type of change and make the message more informative.

The prefixes "fix:", "feat:", "docs:", "style:", "refactor:", "perf:" and
"test:" are commonly used in Git commit messages to indicate the type of changes
that were made in the commit. These prefixes can be useful for quickly identifying 
the purpose of a commit, and can be used as a way to categorize commits in a project.

Here's what each prefix typically indicates:
<ol>
<details>
<summary> "fix: "</summary>
- "fix:" is used to indicate that the commit is a bug fix.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "feat: "</summary>
    - "feat:" is used to indicate that the commit is a new feature.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "docs: "</summary>
    - "docs:" is used to indicate that the commit is related to documentation.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "style: "</summary>
    "style:" is used to indicate that the commit is related to code formatting, indentation, and other style-related changes.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "refactor: "</summary>
    "refactor:" is used to indicate that the commit is related to code refactoring, which is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its functionality.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "perf: "</summary>
    "perf:" is used to indicate that the commit is related to performance improvements.
</details>
<details>
<summary> "test: "</summary>
    "test:" is used to indicate that the commit is related to adding, modifying or removing tests.
</details>
</ol>

It is important to mention that these prefixes are not standard across all the
projects and teams, you can use them or not, and you can also define your own
prefixes according to the needs of your project.

It's also important to include a short summary of the changes made in the
commit message. This summary should be written in a way that is clear,
concise, and informative, so that other developers can understand what was
done and why.
